## Description

### What needs are we meeting?
* You are an employee,
    * who needs to bring accountability to your team,
    * So you need a team profile generator.


### What would be the foreseeable consequences if the needs are unmet?
* You will not be able to track who has which role in your team, and some people may get lost in the sharing of duties.


### What were your goals?
* Create Constructor Class templates for each role title.
* Create HTML card templates for each person.
* Create 3 series of inquirer prompts for the 3 role titles.
* Create a JS engine that processes user's input through Constructor Classes, and modifies the HTML card templates, and then puts all the cards into a finished HTML.
* Output the finished HTML into a separate folder.


### What have you done about it?
* All goals are met.


## Installation

* You need to install nodejs to your local computer.
* You need to create package.json and node_modules by entering:
    1. ``` npm init -y ```
    2. ``` npm install inquirer ```
    3. ``` npm install path ```
* Run ``` node index.js ``` on your command line, and follow the prompts.


## Features

* Given you have started ``` node index.js ``` on your command line,
    * When you do not enter any inputs,
        - Then prompt will give an error message, and refuse to continue.
    * When you finish the prompts,
        - Then the application will create a new html file with your inputs inside ``` output ``` folder.
